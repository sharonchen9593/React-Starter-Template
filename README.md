## About the Files ##

### .gitignore ###
Ignores the node_modules folder when pushing to GitHub.

### app.js ###
Very simple server so that the project can be deployed to Heroku.

### package.json ###
Have to have script: postinstall for Heroku to run the second package.json in the public folder.

### webpack.config.js ###
Configures Webpack to use Babel to compile all ES6 syntax into bundle.js in the public folder.
  
  
### public (folder) ###
Public folder where all your front-end code will be.

#### package.json ####
Installs all dependecies for React to run.

#### bundle.js ####
Do not edit this file. It will be auto updated by Webpack.

#### index.html ####
Basic HTML template. Imported all the React files so we don't have to type "import React from 'react'" in every single component.

#### src ####
Your app components.
